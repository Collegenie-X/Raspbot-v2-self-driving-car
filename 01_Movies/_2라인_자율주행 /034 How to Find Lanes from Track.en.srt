00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,370
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,280
So from our previous videos we have done all the basic image processing.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:15,570
Now in this video I will try to find the exact lead positions so far on my program.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,270
These are my lead lines.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,910
And in this video I will try to find the exact position of these lines with respect to the left side

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,830
of this frame.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,480
So let's close this.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:41,850
Now let us suppose this is over a frame and in this frame we have to lay lines let's say these are our

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:50,070
lean lines.

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,220
Now we have a frames and we have two lean lines.

11
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:00,190
Next I have to find a position off over a first line with respect to the left side of your frame.

12
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,390
Let's say that this distance will be a.

13
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,990
And we also have to find the position of this line with respect to the left side of your frame.

14
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:16,040
So let's say this distance will be be in our image processing.

15
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:23,020
We have to find the value of A and B at this time we also know our framework is fought under.

16
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,200
We updated a little framework.

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,820
And our frame height is 240.

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,370
Now the next question is how we can find these distances.

19
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,150
How we can find the value of A and B.

20
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,380
So to find the value of A and B I will again create a reason of interest.

21
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,620
So I will create a reason often best at the bottom and the size of this reason.

22
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,370
Interest really depends upon your choice.

23
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:58,160
So I have tried many reason of interest in this project but I find the best possible size is this.

24
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,530
So I will create a reason of interest of this size.

25
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,140
So let's say the word.

26
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:13,340
We know the words of although reason enough interest will be 400 and this hired will be a hundred and

27
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,040
the next question is how we can implement this reason of interest.

28
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,480
In other C++ language so we can implement this reason of interest by a rectangular command.

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,560
So for of rectangular more we need two points.

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,620
So our first plant will be this one.

31
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,730
And our second point will be this one.

32
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:40,430
So basically these are two gardeners and with these two gardeners we can draw a rectangle in our open

33
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,590
TV.

34
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,900
So let's say the coordinate of our first plant will be 0 0 mile 1 40

35
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:57,870
because of our frame height is 240 and a word of this reason often plus is hundred.

36
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:07,030
So the cardinal of this plant will be 0 or more 140 and Cardinals for this plant will be 400 which is

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,630
our frame word and frame height is our 240 here.

38
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,000
So the cardinals will be 400 comma 240 here.

39
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:25,150
Now I will use a rectangular command to read this of is enough interest in open TV so the syntax is

40
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,150
this rectangular.

41
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,350
Now for this event Look Ma we have four different parameters.

42
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,800
First is x.

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:44,020
Second is y told will be X plus a and fourth will be white plus B.

44
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,250
Now let's fill these values.

45
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,080
So rectangular.

46
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,360
Now what X and Y.

47
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,850
So the X and Y will be our first point.

48
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,890
So the first point is zero.

49
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,800
Come 140.

50
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,710
Now let us discuss both what are a and b.

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,880
So Ian B.

52
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,330
Nada.

53
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:14,800
These values of A will be the worth of this reason often trust and b will be the height of this reason

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,240
often trust.

55
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:23,260
So worth of reason often trust is 400 so 400 plus 0 will be 400

56
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,520
next why.

57
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:35,200
We know why is 140 and B is this hundred so we can see this value will be 240.

58
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:43,030
Now if I execute this command in our open TV then I will get this rectangle.

59
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:49,690
Now in the next half we have to process this rectangle in order to find the exact position of these

60
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,430
lead lines.

61
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,490
Now in open TV we cannot process this whole reason of interest at once.

62
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,050
So we have to divide this reason of interest into different strips.

63
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,170
So let's say I will divide this reason of interest into different strips

64
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:18,170
already so I divided my whole reason of interest into different strips and the worth of these tips will

65
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:27,350
be one pixel so same for all the shapes the worth of all the strips will be one pixel and height be

66
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:34,190
no height we have hundred pixels so the height is hundred pixels at this one if we get weird how many

67
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,550
pixels are in months.

68
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,210
So we can easily calculated so this will be hundred into one.

69
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:47,270
So in one step there will be total one hundred pixels and each pixels has an intensity of zero because

70
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:55,100
each pixel is dark so we can multiply with the needle and we will get the resultant intensity of the

71
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,000
zero and we will store this intensity in dynamic edit here.

72
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:07,390
So let's say our first element is zero because the intensity of one of our first trip is zero.

73
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,690
In the next step I will try to calculate the intensity for our next trip.

74
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,960
So next trip we have hundred pixel and each pixels have intensity zeros or hundred multiplied by zero

75
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,750
will be zero.

76
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,980
Same for our third strip.

77
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,950
Same for our fourth strip.

78
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:33,050
Now if I will get rid of the intensity for my fifth this trip then begin see we have total one hundred

79
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:40,980
pixels and each pixels had the intensity of 255 because each pixels are in white color.

80
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:46,330
We can multiply one hundred with their 255 and we will get some values.

81
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:55,590
So let's say this value is X and we will fill this value in this edit here X again.

82
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:03,630
If we try to process our next move so we will get zero again zero zero.

83
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:13,130
Then we will try to process this it will again get the value let's say x and gain for next trip X and

84
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:20,810
for all of the steps the value will be zero.

85
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,310
I also mentioned earlier the worth of each strip is one pixel.

86
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,760
So we need total 400 pixels in order to process our whole reason of interest.

87
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:39,710
So this will be over Eddie and in this added there will be total 400 elements and all these elements

88
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,770
will correspond to the intensity of each step for a reason of interest.

89
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:52,610
So this is the basic strategy that I will use to calculate the position of these chips.

90
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:59,300
Now this whole process is somehow related to the histogram process so we can also say we are calculating

91
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,370
it has to go for this image to calculate the position of these two lines.

92
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:11,480
Now let us implement the same thing in our C++ so let's go back to our project.
