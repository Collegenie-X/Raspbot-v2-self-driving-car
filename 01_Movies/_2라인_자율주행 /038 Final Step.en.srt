00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,900
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:09,790
At this point we are done with our calibration and this is the output from our previous video of a Lin

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,890
center is perfectly overlapping with all frames into now onwards.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,390
We will start working on how we can steal our car between the lanes for this task.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,540
We will need a variable that will tell us how much we are all set from our frame center.

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,920
All we can see how much is the difference between a lean centered and frame centered is for this task.

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,720
I will define a new variable here.

8
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,860
I will define the integer redeemable.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,510
So let's say my variable name will be reserved and I will take a difference between Lane center and

10
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,600
frame center.

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,410
So Lane center minus frame center

12
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,600
next I have to declare this globally.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,790
So I will declare it here.

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,670
So this is my result variable.

15
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:11,750
So in the next step I have to show this is old function on my original stream here on this frame.

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,720
I was sure this reserved for this task.

17
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,560
I will use the string stream.

18
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:23,410
So let us declare is string stream small string stream.

19
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,380
The name of the string stream will be let's say.

20
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,810
So this is the functionality of C++ but if you do not know about Springsteen seem you can easily learn

21
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,520
from Google.

22
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,200
Next will be your void main function.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,800
So in the y loop I will define in detail to my string stream.

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:53,980
So let us first initialize this SS da SDR initialized with this space.

25
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:00,950
Next I will clear my previous string stream.

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,170
Next I will type that data to this string stream so data will be there say first I want to print the

27
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:10,710
desired

28
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,880
next every time the variable so desert variable.

29
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,940
Next I will use the opposite in functionality to print any text on the image so I will used up for text.

30
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,900
First parameter is what image so I just want a print on the frame.

31
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:45,750
Next I have to define my strings or SS da SDR for the data.

32
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,200
Next I have to define the point where I want to print the name.

33
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,550
So point to F.

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,940
So let's say one column of 50.

35
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:01,300
This will be the position next to parameters are the default which will describe the text type and text

36
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,800
scaling.

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,240
So I will type 0 column or 1 or default parameters.

38
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,640
Next will be of a color.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,770
So scalar let's say I just want to print in the red color 0 0 0 0 0 mark 255

40
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:28,520
and last is a word bit of their text so let's say 2 pixels next compiler program.

41
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,990
All right so we have a edit I think again I made a silly text mistake.

42
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,160
Yes it is here.

43
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,700
So it is a string stream.

44
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,150
Next build it again.

45
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,000
All right so compilation is successful.

46
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,480
Let's run the program.

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,790
We can see the Z on the frame right now.

48
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,870
Our frame center is totally overlapping with a our line center.

49
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,640
That's why we are seeing a difference of zero.

50
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,060
Now let's do some experimentation with our self-driving car.

51
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,410
Let's move this to the left hand side.

52
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,620
That's perfect.

53
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,750
What is that video will have some positive value because we have offset between our lane center and

54
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,540
a low frame center which we can see from our final frame image.

55
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,660
Now let's try to move this Jesse to the other side.

56
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,910
All right now over a third variable goes negative.

57
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,790
Now move to the center and let's go back to our programming.

58
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:39,590
Alright so from this a variable I will steal my car between the lanes we have seen.

59
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,710
If I move my car into the left hand side then my Z video will goes positive.

60
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:51,360
But with some value in the same way if I move my car to the right hand side then this and variable goes

61
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,140
negative with some magnitude really so positive and negative saying shows that direction of movement

62
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,800
and magnitude are we can see the value defined the amount of movement to the particular direction.

63
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,960
So now onwards.

64
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,490
Bit of a result variable I will send the instruction to obviously device that is over Arduino you know

65
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,070
for communication.

66
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,320
I will try to connect the is helpings of raspberry pi to the Arduino you know to establish a communication

67
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,470
link but you can also use this severe communication if you want.

68
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:29,020
So far this project I believe is the parallel communication with the digital bins.

69
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,600
So in the next video we will see the process how we will connect a Raspberry Pi to our R2 we know you

70
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:34,880
know.
